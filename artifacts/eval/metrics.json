  "orig_transcript": "The Clockmaker's Lantern. In a quiet town tucked between misty hills, there lived an old clockmaker named Ravel. His workshop, squeezed between a bakery and a tailor shop, was easy to miss, except at night. Then, the soft glow of a single lantern shimmered through the dusty window, and the rhythmic ticking of dozens of clocks drifted into the cobblestone street like a steady heartbeat. Orzath had a habit. Every evening just after sunset, he would wind each of his clocks by hand. Not because they needed it, but because he believed each tick carried a memory, and memories should never be allowed to fade. Some clocks chimed gently, others rang proudly, but one clock never made a sound at all. It was a tiny brass pocket watch resting inside a velvet box. It had no hands and no numbers, only a smooth golden surface. One night, as Ravel was closing the shop, the silent watch began to glow. Not like a reflection or a trick of the lantern, but a warm, living light, as if a sunrise had bloomed inside it. Ravel froze. He had crafted that watch long ago for someone he loved deeply, someone he had not seen in many years.",
